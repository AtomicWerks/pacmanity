If you lose your computer, it is often difficult to remember which packages to install.  Plist-Gist automatically saves your package list to a secret, secure gist as a backup, which makes it easy to reinstall all of your applications in the event of a meltdown.  It also can be useful in tracing the installation of bloatware, or troubleshooting system issues.
